# Text-Summarizer
The text summarizer will generate a text summary and will return relevant links from the topic name (top 3 google search resutls) In the sample output image below I have used the srt_file (subtitles file) from the deep.mp4 video. The contents of the srt_file are stored as text using the srt_to_txt() function and the operations are carried out on the text.

We used famous NLP based libraries like nltk, spacy, genshim etc. to execute this project.
